# Nectars - Restaurant Menu Creator

In Participation for We Are Millions Hackathon, a submission for [Best Web2 App Using Swarm Decentralized Storage](https://gitcoin.co/issue/fairdatasociety/wam/14/100027825)

## Descriptions

Nectars is a Restaurant Menu creator, where anyone can use it to make their own menu. The menu data then stored in SWARM Decentralized Storage. Created menu will then have QR code / URL that can be accessed publicly by their customer to view the Menu online.

## How It Works

User creates their resto menu in the Menu Creators, upload every menu image, add descriptions, price, and category. Also user can customize the background and header color.
After user finished with the menu, user then click create page.
The app will then compile it to JSON, stored to SWARM, then user can get their menu QR Code (URL Link).
User can download the QR Code to be placed in their resto tables, or anywhere so user can see their menu online.
